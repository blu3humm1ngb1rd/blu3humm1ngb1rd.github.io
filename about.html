<p>So, here I am well into my career as a American Sign Language interpreter and I have decided to do a complete career change. I literally am at the point in my career that I always dreamed about when first studying interpreting in my undergrad program. I have made so many amazing friends, had incredible life-changing experiences, and been so honored to be part of the Deaf community. I have literally been witness to a mother giving birth while interpreting. I can not say enough about how amazing my job is.</p>

<p>Given the incredible experiences and fun challenges my job creates, I have been wanting more for a long time. My parents, now retired, were computer scientists. I had a glimpse into their world at a young age and as much as I was curious, I also wanted to go in my own direction. Well, been there and done that and now wanting to explore what sparked my curiousity and interest at such a young age. I would be remiss not to add that my parents are THRILLED at my decision. What is most gratifying is that I'm making this decision now with complete clarity to follow what I want. Following in someone's footsteps, even really cool parent footsteps', is not something I can do. I want to pave my own way. I have traversed through interpreting, earning my graduate degree, and now ready to apply that experience to Software Engineering. I am eager to learn the tools to put my ideas into creation!</p>
