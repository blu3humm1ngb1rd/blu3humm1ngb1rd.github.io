I am still in shock that the program is coming to a close. I feel overall that I did exactly what I set out to accomplish, and actually managed to sleep along the way! (Not like, sleep in lazy weekend days, but like at least 5-7 hours kind of sleep). I am really proud of what I've accomplished and also have some pointers to those who are starting out. 

### Read the docs! 
I did get a few books for extra study, "Eloquent Ruby" so far is my favorite. However, at the end of the day it is the actual documentation that has been the best resource. I'm adding some links at the bottom. Add them to your bookmark toolbar. I think this is mostly speaking to those born in the 80s or earlier, or those who share a love of highlighting - print out key articles and mark them up! I tried to force myself to go digital when starting the program. For notes and referring to them later, pen to paper wins every time. Also, digital doodling just isn't the same. Honestly, most of my notes I did not even go back to, but they helped me to focus and cement the concepts a bit more than just reading them. 

### Study buddies
I attended an orientation prior to choosing Flatiron, it conisted of former students sharing their experience. The number one piece of advice they gave was to study with others. In all honesty, this is a million times harder than it sounds. I can't tell you how many study groups I set up and posted on Learn or in my channel's slack and no one came. Zero regrets. Eventually I found some great people to work with and squad-up....is that a term? Concept is solid though. This program was an investment in myself and my future, why would I not spend every moment giving at least 100% and trying to reach out to my fellow students? As defeating as it felt at times, it is like the second most thing I'm proud of aside from learning the curriculum. 

### Attend lectures and participate 
Depending on the week, I had either read the material ahead or was several lessons behind. Very rarely anywhere in between. I still attended all but one lectures. I don't know if I ever really got the hang of the best way to participate during lectures. I tried to code-along every now and then, but it's pretty hard to do with all new material. When I had time, I would re-watch the lectures and try to duplicate whatever was created earlier. It was tempting to skip lecture or just mute myself and turn of my video for the class when I wasn't familiar with the material yet, however I stand by the decision to just stick it out and try and figure it out. Asking questions, even when they seemed outlandish or irrelevant, was really helpful. It's like when you make a huge mistake and it is then burned in your mind and you're not going to make the same mistake again... similar idea. If I asked something super obvious to everyone else, or seemingly a 'bad question' whatever the answer was got seered into my mind. The benefit far outweighed the discomfort. Also, having taught numerous trainings and workshops over the year with my day job, I know it's a lot more fun for the instructor if there's dialogue and participation.
